<div class="story-body scrollytelling">
    <h1>C H A R T * O N E</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time we built this for homework</h2>

    <div id="chart-1" class="chart">
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
      <div class='step'>
        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each button should be turned into a step (scroll down to see them).</li>
          <li>When I resize, the graphic should scale to the <strong>width of its container, but not the height</strong>.</li>
          <li>It would be nice if you gave me a sentence to pretend this is a story instead of just "here's Africa!" Not that we have a strong story, of course.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>It should look like <a href="assets/chart-1.mp4">this</a> when you're done.</p>
